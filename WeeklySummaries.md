# Weekly progress updates for summer scholarship.


## Week One:

The week started out with meetings with Gillian and then Arts Access Aotearoa and me familiarising myself with the environment I will be developing in for the next few weeks. At the meeting with Gillian the intended outcome for the project was to make a skill that takes what eddie did for the eventfinda api and either extend it or create a new skill based on what he did for the Arts Access Aotearoa database. Another thing that I want to ensure during the development of this project is to build it in such a way that if someone else comes to this project in future there is quality documentation of how the project was built/designed, the decision making process involved and also that it be built in javascipt for the best possible access to documentation. Not to say that eddies work wasn't great, it was, but his readme/documentation is not particularly verbose or clear. The project is also entirely built in typescript which while being a subset of javascript it is a significantly more niche syntactical application (meaning that if looking up documentation for a projject you then have to parse that into typescript syntax). My main focus this week was to acclimate to an alexa skill development environment and get to grips with the scope of the project. The biggest hurdle that we have encountered thus far with the project is that flightdec/ArtsAccessAotearoa does not have an existing api, meaning that the functionality of the project hinges on that becoming available. The only other option I can think of is some kind of python scraper (Im familiar with the concept but I haven't really done much with python). The other thing that I have encountered is the Jovo framework which allows you to build skills/applications for both alexa and google assistant simultaneously which would increase the availability of the voice skill. I would have to look up the viability of it as a development option though. In short the first week has inolved a lot of familiarization with the development environment as well as the scope of the project and potential hurdles that we might encounter.
